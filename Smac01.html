			<h2>Open Source Community</h2>
			<p>Open source has become the de facto way to build software — not only in tech, but across diverse industries. As companies use open source code to build their own commercial products and services, they also see the strategic value of contributing back to those projects. There are open source you can try such Python, Open Office, Android, Linux Operation system, VLC media and so on.</p>

			<p>We invite every one to join the open source community to built the strong environment to create and share projects and ideas. And you also open source software and source code from open souce platforms like Github, Gitlab, Bitbukket and from many other sites.</p>

				<h3>Linux </h3>
				<p>Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware. Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a then-student at the University of Helsinki.<img src="images/5.png" width="200" height="200" alt="linux"> Torvalds built Linux as a free and open source alternative to Minix, another Unix clone that was predominantly used in academic settings. There are almost six hundred Linux distributions exist, with close to five hundred out of those in active development.</p>
